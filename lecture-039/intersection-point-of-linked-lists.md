# Intersection Point Of Linked Lists

`Easy`

> 1.  You are given a partially written LinkedList class.
> 2.  You are required to complete the body of findIntersection function. The function is passed two linked lists which start separately but merge at a node and become common thereafter. The function is expected to find the point where two linked lists merge. You are not allowed to use arrays to solve the problem.
> 3.  Input and Output is managed for you.

## Input Format

> Input is managed for you

## Output Format

## Constraints

> 1.  Time complexity -> O(n)
> 2.  Space complexity -> constant
