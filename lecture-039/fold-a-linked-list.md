# Fold A Linked List

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.
> 2. You are required to complete the body of fold function. The function is expected to place last element after 1st element, 2nd last element after 2nd element and so on. For more insight check the example

## Example 1

```
1->2->3->4->5
will fold as
1->5->2->4->3
```

## Example 2

```
1->2->3->4->5->6
1->6->2->5->3->4
```

## Input Format

> Input is managed for you

## Output Format

> Output is managed for you

Constraints

> 1. Time complexity -> O(n)
> 2. Space complexity -> Recursion space, O(n)

## Sample Input

```
5
1 2 3 4 5
10
20
```

## Sample Output

```
1 2 3 4 5
1 5 2 4 3
10 1 5 2 4 3 20
```

## Solution
