# Longest Consecutive Sequence Of Elements

`Hard`

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
> 2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
> 3. You are required to print the longest sequence of consecutive elements in the array (ignoring duplicates).

- Note -> In case there are two sequences of equal length (and they are also the longest), then print the one for which the starting point of which occurs first in the array.

## Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 30
- 0 <= n1, n2, .. n elements <= 15

## Format

## Input

- A number n

```
n1
n2
.. n number of elements
```

## Output

- Elements of longest sequence of consecutive elements of array in separate lines (ignoring duplicates)
