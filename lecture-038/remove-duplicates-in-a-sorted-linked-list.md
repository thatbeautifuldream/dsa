`Easy`

> 1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.
> 2. You are required to complete the body of removeDuplicates function. The function is called on a sorted list. The function must remove all duplicates from the list in linear time and constant space
> 3. Input and Output is managed for you.

## Input Format

`Input is managed for you`

## Output Format

`Output is managed for you`

## Constraints

> 1. Time complexity -> O(n)
> 2. Space complexity -> constant
