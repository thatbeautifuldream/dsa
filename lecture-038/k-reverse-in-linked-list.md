# K Reverse In Linked List

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a partially written LinkedList class.
> 2. You are required to complete the body of kReverse function. The function is expected to tweak the list such that all groups of k elements in the list get reversed and linked. If the last set has less than k elements, leave it as it is (don't reverse).
> 3. Input and Output is managed for you.

## Input Format

`Input is managed for you`

## Output Format

`Output is managed for you`

## Constraints

> 1. Time complexity -> O(n)
> 2. Space complexity -> constant
