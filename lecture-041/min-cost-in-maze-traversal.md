# Min Cost In Maze Traversal

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the number of rows.
> 2. You are given a number m, representing the number of columns.
> 3. You are given n\*m numbers, representing elements of 2d array a, which represents a maze.
> 4. You are standing in top-left cell and are required to move to bottom-right cell.
> 5. You are allowed to move 1 cell right (h move) or 1 cell down (v move) in 1 motion.
> 6. Each cell has a value that will have to be paid to enter that cell (even for the top-left and bottom-
>    right cell).
> 7. You are required to traverse through the matrix and print the cost of path which is least costly.

## Input Format

```
A number n
A number m
e11
e12..
e21
e22..
.. n * m number of elements
```

## Output Format

## Constraints

> 1. 1 <= n <= 10^2
> 2. 1 <= m <= 10^2
> 3. 0 <= e1, e2, .. n \* m elements <= 1000
