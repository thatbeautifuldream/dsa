# Climb Stairs With Variable Jumps

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the number of stairs in a staircase.
> 2. You are on the 0th step and are required to climb to the top.
> 3. You are given n numbers, where ith element's value represents - till how far from the step you
>    could jump to in a single move.  
>     You can of course jump fewer number of steps in the move.
> 4. You are required to print the number of different paths via which you can climb to the top.
