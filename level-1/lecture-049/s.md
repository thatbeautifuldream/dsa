# Sort K-sorted Array

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the size of array a.
> 2. You are given n numbers, representing elements of array a.
> 3. The array is nearly sorted. Every element is at-max displaced k spots left or right to it's position in the sorted array. Hence it is being called k-sorted array.
> 4. You are required to sort and print the sorted array.

- Note -> You can use at-max k extra space and nlogk time complexity.

## Constraints

- 0 <= n1, n2, .. n elements <= 100
- 0 < k <= n
