# Water Regions

`Easy`

> 1. Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an.
> 2. Each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai).
> 3. "n" vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0).
> 4. Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a region, such that the region contains the most water.
>    Note : that you may not slant the container.
