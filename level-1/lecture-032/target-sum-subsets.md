# Target Sum Subsets

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the count of elements.
> 2. You are given n numbers.
> 3. You are given a number "tar".
> 4. Complete the body of printTargetSumSubsets function - without changing signature - to calculate and print all subsets of given elements, the contents of which sum to "tar". Use sample input and output to get more idea.

> `Note -> The online judge can't force you to write the function recursively but that is what the spirit of question is. Write recursive and not iterative logic. The purpose of the question is to aid learning recursion and not test you.`

```
Input Format
A number n
n1
n2
.. n number of elements
A number tar
Output Format
Comma separated elements of the subset, the contents of which add to "tar"
.. all such subsets, each in a single line (the elements of each subset should be comma separated)

Constraints
1 <= n <= 30
0 <= n1, n2, .. n elements <= 20
0 <= tar <= 50
Sample Input
5
10
20
30
40
50
60
Sample Output
10, 20, 30, .
10, 50, .
20, 40, .
```

## Solution

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    // ! Agenda
    // Problem : Target Sum Subsets
    // asf is answer so far
    // sum is sum of subset
    // tar is target
    public static void printTargetSumSubsets(int[] arr, int idx, String asf, int sum, int tar) {
        if (idx == arr.length) { // base case when we reach the end of the array
            if (tar == sum) { // if the sum of the subset is equal to the target
                System.out.println(asf + "."); // print the subset
            }
            return; // return out of the function
        }
        // picked
        printTargetSumSubsets(arr, idx + 1, asf + arr[idx] + ", ", sum + arr[idx], tar);
        // not picked
        printTargetSumSubsets(arr, idx + 1, asf, sum, tar);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = sc.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = sc.nextInt();
        }
        int tar = sc.nextInt();
        printTargetSumSubsets(arr, 0, "", 0, tar);
        sc.close();
    }
}
```
