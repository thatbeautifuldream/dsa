# Coin Change Combination

`Easy`

> 1. You are given a number n, representing the count of coins.
> 2. You are given n numbers, representing the denominations of n coins.
> 3. You are given a number "amt".
> 4. You are required to calculate and print the number of combinations of the n coins using which the amount "amt" can be paid.
>    Note1 -> You have an infinite supply of each coin denomination i.e. same coin denomination can be used for many installments in payment of "amt"
>    Note2 -> You are required to find the count of combinations and not permutations i.e.
>    2 + 2 + 3 = 7 and 2 + 3 + 2 = 7 and 3 + 2 + 2 = 7 are different permutations of same
>    combination. You should treat them as 1 and not 3.
