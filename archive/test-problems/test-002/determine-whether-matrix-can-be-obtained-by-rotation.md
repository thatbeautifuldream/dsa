# Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation

`Easy`

> Given two n x n binary matrices mat and target, return true if it is possible to make mat equal to target by rotating mat in 90-degree increments, or false otherwise.

```
Constraints
n == mat.length == target.length
n == mat[i].length == target[i].length
1 <= n <= 10
mat[i][j] and target[i][j] are either 0 or 1.
